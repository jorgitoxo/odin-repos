## First of all, get rid of their default styling.

## Next, give the radio buttons a reasonable base style â€” the style they have when the page first loads. This can be anything you like, but you probably want to set a width and height (of somewhere between about 18 and 24 pixels), and a subtle border and/or background color.

## Now give the radio buttons a different style for when they are selected.

## Align the radio buttons nicely with the labels.
