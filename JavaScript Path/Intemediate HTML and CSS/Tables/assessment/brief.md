# Assessment brief
> Structure some data on the planets in our solar system into an accessible HTML table.

## Steps to complete
1. Open your copy of blank-template.html, and start the table off by giving it an outer container, a table header, and a table body. You don't need a table footer for this example.
2. Add the provided caption to your table.
3. Add a row to the table header containing all the column headers.
4. Create all the content rows inside the table body, remembering to make all the row headings into headings semantically.
5. Ensure all the content is placed into the right cells — in the raw data, each row of planet data is shown next to its associated planet.
6. Add attributes to make the row and column headers unambiguously associated with the rows, columns, or row groups that they act as headings for.
7. Add a black border just around the column that contains all the planet name row headers.

## Hints and tips
- The first cell of the header row needs to be blank, and span two columns.
- The group row headings (e.g. Jovian planets) that sit to the left of the planet name row headings (e.g. Saturn) are a little tricky to sort out — you need to make sure each one spans the correct number of rows and columns.
- One way of associating headers with their rows/columns is a lot easier than the other way.
